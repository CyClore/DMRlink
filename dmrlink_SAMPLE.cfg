# NETWORK REPORTING CONFIGURATION
#   Enabling "REPORT_NETWORKS" will cause a reporting action for
#   IPSC each time the periodic reporting loop runs, that period is
#   specifiec by "REPORT_INTERVAL" in seconds. Possible values
#   for "REPORT_NETWORKS" are:
#       PICKLE - a Python pickle file of the network's data structure
#       (JSON DOES NOT WORK RNIGHT NOW) JSON - a JSON file of the network's data structure
#       (REDIS DOES NOT WORK RIGHT NOW) REDIS - send JSON format data structure to a local|remote
#               redis server
#       PRINT - a pretty print (STDOUT) of the data structure
#           "PRINT_PEERS_INC_MODE" - Boolean to include mode bits
#           "PRINT_PEERS_INC_FLAGS" - Boolean to include flag bits
#
#   PRINT is the odd man out because it sends prettily formatted stuff
#   to STDOUT. The others send the internal data structure of the IPSC
#   instance and let some program on the other end sort it out.
#
#   REPORT_INTERVAL - Seconds between reports
#   REPORT_PATH - Absolute path save data (pickle and json)

# SYSTEM LOGGER CONFIGURAITON
#   This allows the logger to be configured without chaning the individual
#   python logger stuff in dmrlink.py. LOG_FILE should be a complete
#   path/filename for *your* system -- use /dev/null for non-file handlers.
#   LOG_HANDERLS may be any of the following, please, no spaces in the
#   list if you use several:
#       null
#       console
#       console-timed
#       file
#       file-timed
#       syslog
#   LOG_LEVEL may be any of the standard syslog logging levels, though
#   as of now, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and CRITICAL are the only ones
#   used.

# DOWNLOAD AND IMPORT SUBSCRIBER, PEER and TGID ALIASES
# Ok, not the TGID, there's no master list I know of to download
# This is intended as a facility for other applcations built on top of
# DMRlink to use, and will NOT be used in DMRlink directly.
# STALE_DAYS is the number of days since the last download before we
# download again. Don't be an ass and change this to less than a few days.

# CONFIGURATION FOR IPSC NETWORKS
# Please read these closely - catastrophic results could result by setting
# certain flags for things DMRlink cannot do.
# 
# [NAME]            The name you want to use to identify the IPSC instance (use
#                   something better than "IPSC1"...)
# ENABLED:          Should we communiate with this network? Handy if you need to
#		            shut one down but don't want to lose the config
# RADIO_ID:         This is the radio ID that DMRLink should use to communicate
# IP:               This is the local IPv4 address to listen on. It may be left
#                   blank if you do not need or wish to specify. It is mostly
#                   useful when DMRlink uses multiple interfaces to serve as an
#                   application gatway/proxy from private and/or VPN networks
#                   to the real world.
# PORT:             This is the UDP source port for DMRLink to use for this
#                   PSC network, must be unique!!!
# ALIVE_TIMER:      Seconds between keep-alive transmissions
# MAX_MISSED:       How many missed keep-alives before we remove a peer
# PEER_OPER:        This signals the master and peers whether or not we are
#                   operational. True is the only thing that makes sense.
# IPSC_MODE:        May be 'DIGITAL', 'ANALOG', or 'NONE'. Digital is really the
#                   only thing that makes sense.
# TSx_LINK:         Is this time slot linked?
# CSBK_CALL:        Should be False, we cannot process these, but may be useful
#                   for debugging.
# RCM:              Repeater Call Monitoring - don't unable unless you plan to
#                   actually use it, this craetes extra network traffic.
# CON_APP:          Third Party Console App - exactly what DMRlink is, should
#                   be set to True.
# XNL_CALL:         Can cause problems if not set to False, DMRlink does not
#                   process XCMP/XNL calls.
# XNL_MASTER:       Obviously, should also be False, see XNL_CALL.
# DATA_CALL:        Process data calls. True if you want to process data calls
# VOICE_CALL:       Process voice calls. True if you want to process voice calls
# MASTER_PEER:      True if DMRlink will be the master, False if we're a peer
# AUTH_ENABLED:     Do we use authenticated IPSC?
# AUTH_KEY:         The Authentication key (up to 40 hex characters)
# MASTER_IP:        IP address of the IPSC master (ignored if DMRlink is the master)
# MASTER_PORT:      UDP port of the IPSC master (ignored if DMRlinkn is the master)
# GROUP_HANGTIME:   Group hangtime, per DMR configuration
#
# ...Repeat the block for each IPSC network to join.
